# motorway_control_sim
Basic implementation of control algorithms on ramp motorways in SUMO simulator

## Description
Practical application of traffic control mechanisms. Traffic is regulared by means of sensors and actuators on a ramp in a motorway. This simulation implements the "Traffic Control Interfece" (TRACI) for SUMO - Simulation of Urban MObility in Python.
